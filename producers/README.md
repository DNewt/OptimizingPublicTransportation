### Step 1: Create Kafka Producers
The first step in our plan is to configure the train stations to emit some of the events that we need. The CTA has placed a sensor on each side of every train station that can be programmed to take an action whenever a train arrives at the station.

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the code in `producers/models/producer.py`
1. Define a `value` schema for the arrival event in `producers/models/schemas/arrival_value.json` with the following attributes
	* `station_id`
	* `train_id`
	* `direction`
	* `line`
	* `train_status`
	* `prev_station_id`
	* `prev_direction`
1. Complete the code in `producers/models/station.py` so that:
	* A topic is created for each station in Kafka to track the arrival events
	* The station emits an `arrival` event to Kafka whenever the `Station.run()` function is called.
	* Ensure that events emitted to kafka are paired with the Avro `key` and `value` schemas
1. Define a `value` schema for the turnstile event in `producers/models/schemas/turnstile_value.json` with the following attributes
	* `station_id`
	* `station_name`
	* `line`
1. Complete the code in `producers/models/turnstile.py` so that:
	* A topic is created for each turnstile for each station in Kafka to track the turnstile events
	* The station emits a `turnstile` event to Kafka whenever the `Turnstile.run()` function is called.
	* Ensure that events emitted to kafka are paired with the Avro `key` and `value` schemas
